        With years of hands-on experience in nannying, nutrition, office and household management and a deep passion for child wellbeing and family support I created Roots & Routines to help families thrive, not just survive.

        Whether it's building nourishing routines, finding the right nanny or planning meals that work for your lifestyle - I've seen firsthand how a bit of guidance can create lasting ease and joy at home.

        My background also includes research, admin and logistics, which means with me you're not just getting heart you're getting strategy.

        With you as the lead let's build your family's rhythm together
