        With years of hands-on experience in nannying, nutrition, office and household management and a deep passion for child wellbeing and family support I created Roots & Routines to help families thrive, not just survive.

        Whether it`&apos;s building nourishing routines, finding the right nanny or planning meals that work for your lifestyle - I`&apos;ve seen firsthand how a bit of guidance can create lasting ease and joy at home.

        My background also includes research, admin and logistics, which means with me you`&apos;re not just getting heart you`&apos;re getting strategy.

        With you as the lead let`&apos;s build your family`&apos;s rhythm together
